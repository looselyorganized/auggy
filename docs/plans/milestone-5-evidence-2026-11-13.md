# Milestone 5 execution evidence

Status: contract preparation only; G0 awaits separately authorized M4 merge and
resulting-main verification. No product acceptance is claimed.

## Preservation and entry checks

The user authorized implementation of the approved M5 plan. Root preserved the
dirty original main checkout and all prior worktrees. New isolated worktree:
`.worktrees/portable-agent-integration`, branch `feat/portable-agent-integration`,
initially based on remote main `911fe1682c76208c1d99d4dc6841bfcaa608dd8d`.
Bun is 1.3.14. No version bump, publication, hosted resource creation or M5 merge.

Read-only GitHub verification found [PR #229](https://github.com/looselyorganized/auggy/pull/229)
open, ready for review and conflict-free at exact reviewed head
`32d7265d0659d5911755e802d18a9f9077b80196`, with all 31 checks passing.
Main remains `911fe168`, tree `d901475a9afb7a9d24dc70c21ac2480bfab78439`.
Root requested the separate merge authorization expressly required by the plan.
Three specialists produced exclusive contract documents. An independent reviewer
checked them against M4 source; root integrated the dispositions below. No product
source, package manifest, lockfile, CI configuration or hosted resource changed.
All M5-00 through M5-10 tasks remain blocked in the ledger. Preparation review is
not G0/G1 acceptance, interface compilation, or product certification.

## Preparation handoffs and independent review

| Specialist | Exclusive output |
| --- | --- |
| `m5_storage_contract` | C1 `storage-replay.md`: generic admission, managed replay, restore guard, bounded inputs, compatibility and falsifying cases |
| `m5_container_contract` | C2 `deployment.md`: pure export, ingress profiles, bounded staging/readiness, Railway records and image lifecycle |
| `m5_integration_contract` | C3/C4 `integration-acceptance.md`: optional app verifier/policy, browser flow, channel protocol proof and evidence |
| `m5_contract_review` | Read-only independent review of the packet against exact M4 source; no producer edits |

Root recorded these source-driven decisions:

- Managed replay requires the runtime's admitted, lease-backed storage capability.
  Caller-owned programmatic stores retain their existing behavior and ownership.
- The restore guard runs before a saved operation response is authorized, as well
  as before new consumption. The existing duplicate-request ordering is retained.
- The non-restored guard guarantee covers Auggy state tools. An out-of-band full
  volume snapshot can roll it back and needs explicit offline recovery or complete
  old-key removal; downstream reconciliation remains separate.
- Railway proxy defaults must follow explicit platform policy. The current
  `resolveTrustedProxies` path-equality heuristic cannot carry over to generic
  `/app/data` roots.
- Public AG-UI operation replay does not imply durable conversation history.
  The reference makes no new transcript-persistence claim or kernel change.

Independent findings and root dispositions:

| Finding | Resolution for preparation | Remaining proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1: proposed Telegram option hook cannot reach the built-in resolved before agent composition | Use a fixture-only startup fetch overlay at the existing HTTP boundary. Keep normal YAML/resolver/client/SQLite behavior; no production hook or custom transport. Reviewer verified the dynamic fetch path and accepted the disposition. | Freeze exact overlay paths after G0; prove packed HTTP traversal, normal SQLite namespace/persistence, production exclusion and safe missing-overlay failure. |
| R2: strict private-root admission omitted first-use Railway volume initialization | Railway-only bootstrap may narrow the mode of an existing, pinned, owned, empty advertised mount using descriptor-based fchmod. Existing nonempty roots receive no repair; generic roots remain operator-provisioned. Reviewer accepted this bounded disposition. | Verify actual base-image UID/GID and platform mount behavior; test fresh default-mode volume and nonempty unsafe/wrong-owner/symlink refusal. |

The independent reviewer re-read the corrected passages and found no remaining
preparation blocker. Root also clarified that ordinary admission may create its
own identity/lock/probe control files before any augment or compatibility state.

Interface compilation, exact accepted-main reconciliation, image UID/GID evidence,
SQLite brand uniqueness and final ownership/path freeze remain M5-00 work. A
source review cannot substitute for those execution checks.

## Preparation validation

- `bun run lint`: passed, 641 files checked, no fixes. Existing informational
  Biome schema mismatch (config 2.5.0 versus CLI 2.5.5) remains unchanged.
- Local packet validation: six files readable as UTF-8 with final newlines and
  no trailing whitespace; relative Markdown links resolve; ledger JSON parses;
  eleven task IDs/dependencies are valid and acyclic; no accepted task/main is
  recorded while G0 is blocked.
- A repeat read-only PR check still found PR #229 open at reviewed `32d7265`,
  conflict-free, with all 31 checks passing and no merge commit.
- Product tests, typecheck, package/container/browser/hosted execution and M5
  certification were not run for these documentation-only changes.

The separate M4 merge request remains pending. No elapsed time, completed draft
or available GitHub credentials is treated as that approval.
